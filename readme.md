# Diabetes Bot Website

Roughly 1 in 5 individuals with diabetes (7.3 million) didn't even know they had it. According to the World Health Organization, about 422 million people across the world have diabetes. 
This Diabetes Application is made to spread awareness about the chronic disease. My web application uses a Diabetes Chatbot which would help in giving information about diabetes. It could answer your questions related to diabetes. The best part of my application, is all this information would be stored and given using a chatbot. Which, currently is popular among millennials, who form one of the largest customer bases, appreciate fast-paced communication and they prefer engaging with chatbot rather than complex applications.

My web application would also help in predicting if someone is at risk of diabete. The application has a form  wherin you have to fill in certain parameters which would help the application to decide if  the user sis at risk of diabetes. This will solve the problem of patients finding out too late that they have diabetes.


Navigating through the application:

1. You will find some popular quotes on the home page, if you will scroll down, you will find the chatbot which could answer all your questions related to diabetes.
2. When You Click on Diabetes Risk Test in the Navigation Bar, You will be taken to anpther page, wherein you could fill the form to know whether you are at risk of diabetes.
